        "### Overall Goal\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a workflow for spot-checking Places Insights data. It starts with a high-level statistical query to find restaurant density and then **directly visualizes both the high-level density and ground-truth sample locations from the city's busiest areas on a single, combined map.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Technologies Used\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **[Places Insights](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/placesinsights):** To provide the Places Data and Place Count Function.\n",
        "*   **[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery):** To run the `PLACES_COUNT_PER_H3` function, which provides aggregated place counts and `sample_place_ids`.\n",
        "*   **[Google Maps Place Details API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-details):** To fetch rich, detailed information (name, address, and a Google Maps link) for the specific `sample_place_ids`.\n",
        "*   **[Google Maps 2D Tiles](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/2d-tiles-overview):** To use Google Maps as the basemap.\n",
        "*   **Python Libraries:**\n",
        "    * **[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)** for spatial data manipulation.\n",
        "    * **[Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/)** for creating the final interactive, layered map.\n",
        "\n",
        "See [Google Maps Platform Pricing](https://mapsplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/pricing/) For API costs assocated with running this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Step-by-Step Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Query Aggregated Data:** We begin by querying BigQuery to count all highly-rated, operational restaurants within a **5km radius of Central London**. We group them into H3 hexagonal cells at **resolution 9**. This query provides the statistical foundation for our analysis and, crucially, a list of `sample_place_ids` for each cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Identify Hotspots & Fetch Details:** The notebook then **automatically** identifies the 20 busiest H3 cells. It consolidates the `sample_place_ids` from all of these top hotspots into a single master list and uses the Places API to fetch detailed information for each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Create a Combined Visualization:** In the final step, we generate a single, layered map.\n",
        "    *   The **base layer** is a choropleth \"heatmap\" showing restaurant density across the search area.\n",
        "    *   The **top layer** displays individual pins for all the sample restaurants from the top 20 hotspots, providing a direct, ground-level view of the locations that make up the aggregated counts. Each pin's popup includes a link to open the location directly in Google Maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How to Use This Notebook**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Set Up Secrets:** Before you begin, you must configure two secrets in the Colab \"Secrets\" tab (the **key icon** on the left menu):\n",
        "    *   `GCP_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud Project ID with access to Places Insights.\n",
        "    *   `GMP_API_KEY`: Your Google Maps Platform API key. Ensure the **Maps Tile API** is enabled for this key in your GCP console.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Run the Cells:** Once the secrets are set, simply run the cells in order from top to bottom. Each visualization will appear as the output of its corresponding code cell."
