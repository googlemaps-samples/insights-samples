    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Retrieval**: Connects to a specified BigQuery project and dataset to fetch `all_assets` and `all_observations` tables.\n",
    "2.  **SQL Query Construction**: Formulates a SQL query to join the asset and observation data, count unique observations per asset and snapshot, and create geographical points from location coordinates.\n",
    "3.  **Data Processing**: Reads the query results into a pandas DataFrame for in-memory analysis.\n",
    "4.  **Statistical Calculation**: Computes overall statistics, including the total number of unique assets, observations, and snapshots. It also determines the distribution of assets based on their number of observations.\n",
    "5.  **Data Visualization**: Generates a pie chart to visually represent the distribution of assets based on their number of observations.\n",
    "6.  **Tabular Output**: Formats and displays key statistics and data samples in a clear, tabular format."
