        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a multi-stage site selection workflow for a new coffee shop in Las Vegas. It combines broad competitive analysis, custom commercial suitability scoring, and target market density analysis to identify prime locations, then visualizes the results on a combined, interactive map.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Technologies Used**\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **[Places Insights](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/placesinsights)**: To provide the core Places dataset and the `PLACES_COUNT_PER_H3` function.\n",
        "*   **[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery):**: To perform large-scale geospatial analysis and calculate suitability scores.\n",
        "*   **[Google Maps Place Details API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-details):** To fetch rich, detailed information (name, address, rating) for specific ground-truth locations.\n",
        "*   **[Google Maps 2D Tiles](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/2d-tiles-overview):** To use Google Maps as the interactive basemap.\n",
        "*   **Python Libraries:**\n",
        "    * **[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/)** for spatial data manipulation.\n",
        "    * **[Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/)** for creating the final interactive, layered map.\n",
        "\n",
        "See [Google Maps Platform Pricing](https://mapsplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/pricing/) For API costs assocated with running this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Step-by-Step Workflow**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Analyze Competitor Density:** We begin by using BigQuery to analyze the distribution of major competitor brands across Clark County ZIP codes. This initial step helps identify broad areas with lower market saturation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Identify Prime Commercial Zones:** The notebook then runs a more sophisticated query to calculate a custom suitability score for H3 hexagonal cells. This score is based on the weighted density of complementary businesses (restaurants, bars, casinos, tourist attractions), pinpointing the most commercially vibrant areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Find Target Market Hotspots & Synthesize:** Next, we use the `PLACES_COUNT_PER_H3` function to find the density of our target business type—coffee shops. The notebook then **automatically** cross-references these coffee shop counts with the highest-scoring suitability zones to identify the most promising cells for a new location.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Create a Combined Visualization:** In the final step, we generate a single, layered map. The **base layer** is a choropleth \"heatmap\" showing the suitability scores across Las Vegas. The **top layer** displays individual pins for existing coffee shops in the top-ranked zones, providing a direct, ground-level view of the current market landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to Use This Notebook**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **\\*\\*Set Up Secrets:\\*\\*** Before you begin, you must configure two secrets in the Colab “Secrets” tab (the 🔑 key icon on the left menu):\n",
        "    *   `GCP_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud Project ID with access to Places Insights.\n",
        "    *   `GMP_API_KEY`: Your Google Maps Platform API key. Ensure the **Maps Tile API** and **Places API (new)** are enabled for this key in your GCP console.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Run the Cells:** Once the secrets are set, simply run the cells in order from top to bottom. Each visualization will appear as the output of its corresponding code cell."
