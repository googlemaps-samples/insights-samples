        "### Overall Goal\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a powerful workflow for generating **Custom Location Scores** (\"suitability scores\") for real estate or travel. Instead of relying solely on raw counts of nearby amenities, we combine **quantitative data** (Google Maps Platform Public Datasets) with **qualitative data** (listing descriptions) and use Generative AI to calculate a nuanced score for a specific user persona (e.g., a \"Young Family\").\n",
        "\n",
        "The result is an **interactive map with color-coded markers**, where the AI not only rates a location (0-10) but provides the **reasoning** behind the score directly in the map popup.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Technologies Used\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **[Places Insights](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/placesinsights):** A Google Maps Platform dataset available in BigQuery that allows for advanced statistical analysis. It provides aggregated counts and density information for Places-of-Interest (POI).\n",
        "*   **[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery):** The serverless data warehouse used to store the listings and execute the analysis.\n",
        "*   **[BigQuery AI.GENERATE](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-generate):** A SQL function that allows us to call Generative AI models (like Gemini) directly within a query to generate scores and text reasoning.\n",
        "*   **[Vertex AI (Gemini)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/):** We use the `gemini-flash-latest` model to analyze the combined data.\n",
        "*   **[Google Maps 2D Tiles](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/tile/2d-tiles-overview):** To use Google Maps as the high-resolution basemap for visualization.\n",
        "*   **Python Libraries:**\n",
        "    * **[Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/)** for creating the final interactive, layered map.\n",
        "    * **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** for handling the synthetic listing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "See [Google Maps Platform Pricing](https://mapsplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/pricing/) and [BigQuery Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) for costs associated with running this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** The `AI.GENERATE` function passes input to a Gemini model and incurs charges in Vertex AI each time it is called. For details on managing these costs, see the **[Best Practices](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-generate#best_practices)** section of the documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Step-by-Step Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Generate Target Candidates:** We begin by creating a dataset of hypothetical apartment listings (including descriptions like \"Quiet street\" vs. \"Busy intersection\"). **To store this data, the notebook automatically creates a dedicated BigQuery dataset in your project.**\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **The AI-SQL Scoring Engine:** We execute a single, powerful SQL query in BigQuery that:\n",
        "    *   Performs a spatial join to count specific amenities (Parks, Schools, Museums) within 800m of each listing.\n",
        "    *   Constructs a natural language prompt combining these counts with the listing description.\n",
        "    *   Calls **Gemini** via `AI.GENERATE` to calculate a \"Family-Friendliness Score\" and explain *why* that score was given.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Visual Analysis:** In the final step, we render the scored locations on a Google Map. We use **color-coded pins** (Green=High Score, Red=Low Score) to instantly identify the best candidates. Clicking a marker reveals a popup with the AI's detailed reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Resource Cleanup:** A final, interactive cell allows you to delete the temporary BigQuery dataset and all its contents, ensuring you leave your project clean.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How to Use This Notebook**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Set Up Secrets:** Before you begin, you must configure two secrets in the Colab \"Secrets\" tab (the **key icon** on the left menu):\n",
        "    *   `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud Project ID.\n",
        "    *   `GMP_API_KEY`: Your Google Maps Platform API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Enable APIs:** Ensure the following APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud Console for the project:\n",
        "    *   **Maps Tiles API** (for the visualization).\n",
        "    *   **Vertex AI API** (for the AI scoring).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Subscribe to Places Insights (US Data):**\n",
        "    This notebook analyzes locations in New York, so you must have access to the United States dataset in BigQuery.\n",
        "    *   **Sign Up:** If you haven't already, [sign up for access](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/placesinsights/cloud-setup) to Places Insights.\n",
        "    *   **Choose Your Dataset:**\n",
        "        *   **Full Data Option:** Subscribe to the full **\"Places Insights - US\"** listing. Ensure your linked dataset is named `places_insights___us`.\n",
        "        *   **Sample Data Option:** You may also use the **[US Sample Data](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/placesinsights/cloud-setup#sample_data)** (\"Places Insights - US - sample\"), as it covers New York City.\n",
        "    *   **Important:** If you use the **Sample Data** (or name your dataset differently), you **must update** the `PLACES_TABLE` variable in **Phase 3** of this notebook to match your linked dataset name (e.g., `places_insights___us___sample`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Run the Cells:** Once the secrets and data subscriptions are ready, simply run the cells in order."
